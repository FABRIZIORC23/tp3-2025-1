% Content
% Data contains cytology features of breast cancer biopsies - clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nuceloli, mitosis. The class variable denotes whether it was cancer or not. Cancer = 1 and not cancer = 0
